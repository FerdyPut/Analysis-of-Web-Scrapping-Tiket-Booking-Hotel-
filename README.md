# Analysis of Web Scrapping Tiket Booking Hotel
Analysis of Web Scrapping is the process of analyzing data obtained through web scraping techniques, which involve automatically extracting data from websites using bots or specific programs. This analysis aims to extract insights, identify trends, or further process the data after the scraping process is completed.

# Steps of Webs Scrapping (Generally)
Web scraping begins by identifying the data source, such as an e-commerce or news website. The data is then extracted using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy, or Selenium for dynamically loaded content. Since the extracted data is often unstructured, it undergoes cleaning to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and convert it into a structured format like CSV or JSON. After cleaning, the data is analyzed using statistics, visualization, or machine learning models to gain insights. Finally, the results are stored in a database or visualized using tools like Looker Studio or Power BI for easier interpretation.

# Case Project
My project involves web scraping on the Tiket.com website, focusing specifically on hotel reservations. Tiket.com is an international official website that offers a wide range of services, including hotel reservations, attraction tickets, flight tickets, and other transportation options. However, this project will be specifically centered on hotel reservations.

# Business Insights/Goals (With Using PostgresQL for ETL):
The data used for web scraping includes hotel, villa, or apartment names, the number of reviews, ratings of these properties, their specific addresses, and pricing details (both before and after discounts).

## Real-World Applications
a) This data can be utilized in hotel booking applications, enabling users to choose accommodations based on price, location, or available amenities. These platforms can offer personalized recommendations based on hotel reviews or ratings, allowing users to make informed decisions based on ratings, pricing conditions, or proximity to their desired location.

b) For businesses, this data helps optimize hotel pricing by analyzing demand trends, competitor prices, and historical occupancy rates. This enables dynamic pricing strategies tailored to different periods, such as holiday seasons, regular weekdays, or special events.

c) The data can be leveraged for targeted promotional campaigns based on user preferences and booking behaviors.

## Benefits of Using PostgreSQL
a) Efficient Data Management – PostgreSQL can efficiently manage hotel-related data, allowing for quick searches and filtering based on criteria such as price, rating, and location.

b) Trend Analysis & Occupancy Insights – PostgreSQL facilitates price trend and hotel occupancy rate analysis, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

c) Handling Large-Scale Data – Given the vast and continuously updated nature of hotel booking data, PostgreSQL can manage historical pricing, newly added accommodations, and frequent updates efficiently. Additionally, it supports multi-year data storage and records from multiple branches or hotel chains.

d) Security & User Experience – Hotel reservation data is crucial for booking processes and user experience, and PostgreSQL provides robust security features to ensure data integrity and protection.

e) Relational Database Capabilities – PostgreSQL enables seamless integration between hotel data and related datasets, such as user profiles, bookings, and reviews.

f) Structured Storage & Fast Query Execution – PostgreSQL ensures structured data storage with efficient querying, making data retrieval and analysis more effective.
